Ensure ``DirEntry.stat().st_ctime`` behaves consistently with
:func:`os.stat` during the deprecation period of ``st_ctime`` by containing
the same value as ``st_birthtime``. After the deprecation period,
``st_ctime`` will be the metadata change time (or unavailable through
``DirEntry``), and only ``st_birthtime`` will contain the creation time.
