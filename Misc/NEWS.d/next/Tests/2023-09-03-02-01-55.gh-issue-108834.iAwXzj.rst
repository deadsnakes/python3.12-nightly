When regrtest reruns failed tests in verbose mode (``./python -m test
--rerun``), tests are now rerun in fresh worker processes rather than being
executed in the main process. If a test does crash or is killed by a timeout,
the main process can detect and handle the killed worker process. Tests are
rerun in parallel if the ``-jN`` option is used to run tests in parallel.
