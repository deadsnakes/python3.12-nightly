Add new tooling, in ``Tools/cases_generator``,
to generate the interpreter switch statement from a list of opcode definitions.
This only affects adding, modifying or removing instruction definitions.
The instruction definitions now live in ``Python/bytecodes.c``,
in the form of a `custom DSL (under development)
<https://github.com/faster-cpython/ideas/blob/main/3.12/interpreter_definition.md>`__.
The tooling reads this file and writes ``Python/generated_cases.c.h``,
which is then included by ``Python/ceval.c`` to provide most of the cases
of the main interpreter switch.
