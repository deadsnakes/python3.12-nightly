Dependencies of :mod:`readline` and :mod:`curses` module are now detected in
``configure`` script with ``pkg-config``. Only ``ncurses`` / ``ncursesw``
are detected automatically. The old ``curses`` library is not configured
automatically. Workaround for missing ``termcap`` or ``tinfo`` library
has been removed.
