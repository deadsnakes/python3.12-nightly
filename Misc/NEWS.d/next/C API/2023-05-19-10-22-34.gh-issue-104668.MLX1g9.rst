Don't call :c:var:`PyOS_InputHook` or :c:var:`PyOS_ReadlineFunctionPointer`
in subinterpreters, since it's generally difficult to avoid using global
state in their registered callbacks. This also avoids situations where
extensions may find themselves running in a subinterpreter they don't
support (or haven't yet been loaded in).
