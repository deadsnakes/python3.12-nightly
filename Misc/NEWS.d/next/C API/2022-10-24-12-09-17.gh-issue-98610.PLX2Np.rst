Some configurable capabilities of sub-interpreters have changed.
They always allow subprocesses (:mod:`subprocess`) now, whereas before
subprocesses could be optionally disaallowed for a sub-interpreter.
Instead :func:`os.exec` can now be disallowed.
Disallowing daemon threads is now supported.  Disallowing all threads
is still allowed, but is never done by default.
Note that the optional restrictions are only available through
``_Py_NewInterpreterFromConfig()``, which isn't a public API.
They do not affect the main interpreter, nor :c:func:`Py_NewInterpreter`.
