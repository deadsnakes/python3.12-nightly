Add new C-API functions for saving and restoring the current exception:
``PyErr_GetRaisedException`` and ``PyErr_SetRaisedException``.
These functions take and return a single exception rather than
the triple of  ``PyErr_Fetch`` and ``PyErr_Restore``.
This is less error prone and a bit more efficient.

The three arguments forms of saving and restoring the
current exception: ``PyErr_Fetch`` and ``PyErr_Restore``
are deprecated.

Also add ``PyException_GetArgs`` and ``PyException_SetArgs``
as convenience functions to help dealing with
exceptions in the C API.
