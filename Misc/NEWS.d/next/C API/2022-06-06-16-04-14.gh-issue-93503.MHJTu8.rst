Add two new public functions to the public C-API,
:c:func:`PyEval_SetProfileAllThreads` and
:c:func:`PyEval_SetTraceAllThreads`, that allow to set tracking and
profiling functions in all running threads in addition to the calling one.
Also, add a new *running_threads* parameter to :func:`threading.setprofile`
and :func:`threading.settrace` that allows to do the same from Python. Patch
