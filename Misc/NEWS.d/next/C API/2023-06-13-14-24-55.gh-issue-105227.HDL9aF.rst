The new :c:func:`PyType_GetDict` provides the dictionary for the given type
object that is normally exposed by ``cls.__dict__``.  Normally it's
sufficient to use :c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_dict`, but for the static
builtin types :c:member:`!tp_dict` is now always ``NULL``.  :c:func:`!PyType_GetDict()`
provides the correct dict object instead.
