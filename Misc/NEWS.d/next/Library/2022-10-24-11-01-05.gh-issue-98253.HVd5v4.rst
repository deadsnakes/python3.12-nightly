The implementation of the typing module is now more resilient to reference
leaks in binary extension modules.

Previously, a reference leak in a typed C API-based extension module could leak
internals of the typing module, which could in turn introduce leaks in
essentially any other package with typed function signatures. Although the
typing package is not the original source of the problem, such non-local
dependences exacerbate debugging of large-scale projects, and the
implementation was therefore changed to reduce harm by providing better
isolation.
