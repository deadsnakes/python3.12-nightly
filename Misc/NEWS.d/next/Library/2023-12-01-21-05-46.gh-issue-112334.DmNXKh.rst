Fixed a performance regression in 3.12's :mod:`subprocess` on Linux where it
would no longer use the fast-path ``vfork()`` system call when it should have
due to a logic bug, instead always falling back to the safe but slower ``fork()``.

Also fixed a related 3.12 security regression: If a value of ``extra_groups=[]``
was passed to :mod:`subprocess.Popen` or related APIs, the underlying
``setgroups(0, NULL)`` system call to clear the groups list would not be made
in the child process prior to ``exec()``.  This has been assigned CVE-2023-6507.

This was identified via code inspection in the process of fixing the first bug.
