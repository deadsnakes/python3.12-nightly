Fix a recent regression in the :mod:`typing` module. The regression meant
that doing ``class Foo(X, typing.Protocol)``, where ``X`` was a class that
had :class:`abc.ABCMeta` as its metaclass, would then cause subsequent
``isinstance(1, X)`` calls to erroneously raise :exc:`TypeError`. Patch by
Alex Waygood.
