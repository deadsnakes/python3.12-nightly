The performance of :func:`isinstance` checks against
:func:`runtime-checkable protocols <typing.runtime_checkable>` has been
considerably improved for protocols that only have a few members. To achieve
this improvement, several internal implementation details of the
:mod:`typing` module have been refactored, including
``typing._ProtocolMeta.__instancecheck__``,
``typing._is_callable_members_only``, and ``typing._get_protocol_attrs``.
