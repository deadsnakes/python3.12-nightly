``importlib.resources.files`` now accepts a module as an anchor instead of
only accepting packages. If a module is passed, resources are resolved
adjacent to that module (in the same package or at the package root). The
parameter was renamed from ``package`` to ``anchor`` with a compatibility
shim for those passing by keyword. Additionally, the new ``anchor``
parameter is now optional and will default to the caller's module.
