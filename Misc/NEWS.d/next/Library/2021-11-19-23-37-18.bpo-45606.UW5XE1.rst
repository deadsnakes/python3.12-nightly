Fixed the bug in :meth:`pathlib.Path.glob` -- previously a dangling symlink
would not be found by this method when the pattern is an exact match, but
would be found when the pattern contains a wildcard or the recursive
wildcard (``**``). With this change, a dangling symlink will be found in
both cases.
