Updated ``importlib.metadata`` with changes from ``importlib_metadata`` 5.2
through 6.5.0, including: Support ``installed-files.txt`` for
``Distribution.files`` when present. ``PackageMetadata`` now stipulates an
additional ``get`` method allowing for easy querying of metadata keys that
may not be present. ``packages_distributions`` now honors packages and
modules with Python modules that not ``.py`` sources (e.g. ``.pyc``,
``.so``). Expand protocol for ``PackageMetadata.get_all`` to match the
upstream implementation of ``email.message.Message.get_all`` in
python/typeshed#9620. Deprecated use of ``Distribution`` without defining
abstract methods. Deprecated expectation that
``PackageMetadata.__getitem__`` will return ``None`` for missing keys. In
the future, it will raise a ``KeyError``.
