Pass the correct ``contextvars.Context`` when a ``asyncio`` exception handler is called on behalf of a task or callback handle. This adds a new ``Task`` method, ``get_context``, and also a new ``Handle`` method with the same name. If this method is not found on a task object (perhaps because it is a third-party library that does not yet provide this method), the context prevailing at the time the exception handler is called is used.
