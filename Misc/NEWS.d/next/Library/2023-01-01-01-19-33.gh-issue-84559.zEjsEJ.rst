The :mod:`multiprocessing` module and
:class:`concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` will emit a
:exc:`DeprecationWarning` on Linux and other non-macOS POSIX systems when
the default multiprocessing start method of ``'fork'`` is used implicitly
rather than being explicitly specified through a
:func:`multiprocessing.get_context` context.

This is in preparation for default start method to change in Python 3.14 to
a default that is safe for multithreaded applications.

Windows and macOS are unaffected as their default start method is ``spawn``.
