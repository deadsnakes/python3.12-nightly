Removed deprecated interfaces in ``importlib.metadata`` (entry points
accessed as dictionary, implicit dictionary construction of sequence of
``EntryPoint`` objects, mutablility of ``EntryPoints`` result, access of
entry point by index). ``entry_points`` now has a simpler, more
straightforward API (returning ``EntryPoints``).
