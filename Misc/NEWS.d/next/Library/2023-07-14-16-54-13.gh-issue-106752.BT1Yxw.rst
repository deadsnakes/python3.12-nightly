Fixed several bugs in zipfile.Path, including: in ``Path.match`, Windows
separators are no longer honored (and never were meant to be); Fixed
``name``/``suffix``/``suffixes``/``stem`` operations when no filename is
present and the Path is not at the root of the zipfile; Reworked glob for
performance and more correct matching behavior.
