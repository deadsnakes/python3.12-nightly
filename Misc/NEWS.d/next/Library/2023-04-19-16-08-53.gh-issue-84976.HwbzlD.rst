Create a new ``Lib/_pydatetime.py`` file that defines the Python version of
the ``datetime`` module, and make ``datetime`` import the contents of the
new library only if the C implementation is missing. Currently, the full
Python implementation is defined and then deleted if the C implementation is
not available, slowing down ``import datetime`` unnecessarily.
