The "pending call" machinery now works for all interpreters, not just the
main interpreter, and runs in all threads, not just the main thread. Some
calls are still only done in the main thread, ergo in the main interpreter.
This change does not affect signal handling nor the existing public C-API
(``Py_AddPendingCall()``), which both still only target the main thread.
The new functionality is meant strictly for internal use for now, since
consequences of its use are not well understood yet outside some very
restricted cases.  This change brings the capability in line with the
intention when the state was made per-interpreter several years ago.
