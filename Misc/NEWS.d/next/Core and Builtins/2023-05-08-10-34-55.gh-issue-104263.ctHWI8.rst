Fix ``float("nan")`` to produce a quiet NaN on platforms (like MIPS) where
the meaning of the signalling / quiet bit is inverted from its usual
meaning. Also introduce a new macro ``Py_INFINITY`` matching C99's
``INFINITY``, and refactor internals to rely on C99's ``NAN`` and
``INFINITY`` macros instead of hard-coding bit patterns for infinities and
NaNs. Thanks Sebastian Berg.
