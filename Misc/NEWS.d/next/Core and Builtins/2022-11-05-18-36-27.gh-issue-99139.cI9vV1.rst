Improve the error suggestion for :exc:`NameError` exceptions for instances.
Now if a :exc:`NameError` is raised in a method and the instance has an
attribute that's exactly equal to the name in the exception, the suggestion
will include ``self.<NAME>`` instead of the closest match in the method
scope. Patch by Pablo Galindo
