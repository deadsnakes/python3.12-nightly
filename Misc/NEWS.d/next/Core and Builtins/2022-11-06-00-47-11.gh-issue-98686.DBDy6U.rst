Merge the adaptive opcode logic into each instruction's unquickened variant,
and merge the logic in ``EXTENDED_ARG_QUICK`` into :opcode:`EXTENDED_ARG`.
With these changes, the quickening that happens at code object creation is
now only responsible for initializing warmup counters and inserting
superinstructions.
