The docs clearly say that ``PyImport_Inittab``,
:c:func:`PyImport_AppendInittab`, and :c:func:`PyImport_ExtendInittab`
should not be used after :c:func:`Py_Initialize` has been called.
We now enforce this for the two functions.  Additionally, the runtime
now uses an internal copy of ``PyImport_Inittab``,
to guard against modification.
