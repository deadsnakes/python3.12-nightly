The GIL is now (optionally) per-interpreter.  This is the fundamental change
for PEP 684.  This is all made possible by virtue of the isolated state of
each interpreter in the process.  The behavior of the main interpreter
remains unchanged.  Likewise, interpreters created using
``Py_NewInterpreter()`` are not affected.  To get an interpreter with its
own GIL, call ``Py_NewInterpreterFromConfig()``.
