Added the methods :c:func:`PyObject_Vectorcall` and
:c:func:`PyObject_VectorcallMethod` to the :ref:`Limited API <stable>` along
with the auxiliary macro constant :const:`PY_VECTORCALL_ARGUMENTS_OFFSET`.

The availability of these functions enables more efficient :PEP:`590` vector
calls from binary extension modules that avoid argument boxing/unboxing
overheads.
