The Garbage Collector now runs only on the eval breaker mechanism of the
Python bytecode evaluation loop instead on object allocations. The GC can
also run when :c:func:`PyErr_CheckSignals` is called so C extensions that
need to run for a long time without executing any Python code also have a
chance to execute the GC periodically.
