Multi-phase init extension modules may now indicate whether or not they
actually support multiple interpreters.  By default such modules are
expected to support use in multiple interpreters.  In the uncommon case that
one does not, it may use the new ``Py_mod_multiple_interpreters`` module def
slot.  A value of ``0`` means the module does not support them. ``1`` means
it does.  The default is ``1``.
