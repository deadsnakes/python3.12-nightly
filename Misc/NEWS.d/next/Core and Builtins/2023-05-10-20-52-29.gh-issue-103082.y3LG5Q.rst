Change behavior of ``sys.monitoring.events.LINE`` events in
``sys.monitoring``: Line events now occur when a new line is reached
dynamically, instead of using a static approximation, as before. This makes
the behavior very similar to that of "line" events in ``sys.settrace``. This
should ease porting of tools from 3.11 to 3.12.
