On a Python built in debug mode, :c:func:`Py_DECREF()` now calls
``_Py_NegativeRefcount()`` if the object is a dangling pointer to
deallocated memory: memory filled with ``0xDD`` "dead byte" by the debug
hook on memory allocators. The fix is to check the reference count *before*
checking for ``_Py_IsImmortal()``. Patch by Victor Stinner.
