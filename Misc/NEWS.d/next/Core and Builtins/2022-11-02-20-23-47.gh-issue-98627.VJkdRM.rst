When an interpreter is configured to check (and only then), importing an
extension module will now fail when the extension does not support multiple
interpreters (i.e. doesn't implement PEP 489 multi-phase init). This does
not apply to the main interpreter, nor to subinterpreters created with
``Py_NewInterpreter()``.
