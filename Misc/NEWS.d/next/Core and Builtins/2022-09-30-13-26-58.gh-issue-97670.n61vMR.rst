Remove the :func:`sys.getdxp` function and the ``Tools/scripts/analyze_dxp.py``
script. DXP stands for "dynamic execution pairs". They were related to
``DYNAMIC_EXECUTION_PROFILE`` and ``DXPAIRS`` macros which have been removed in
Python 3.11. Python can now be built with :option:`./configure --enable-pystats
<--enable-pystats>` to gather statistics on Python opcodes.  Patch by Victor
Stinner.
